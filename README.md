# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using Java. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking spaces on the board with their respective symbols, 'X' and 'O'. The objective is to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
# Getting Started
To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java code using a Java compiler.
3. Execute the compiled class file (Main.class) to start the game.
# How to Play
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid displayed on the console.
2. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.
3. Valid moves are within the range of 0 to 2 and must correspond to an empty space on the board.
4. The game continues until one player achieves three of their symbols in a row or all spaces on the board are filled.
5. If a player wins, a victory message is displayed.
